```Solidity

pragma solidity 0.8.15;

contract MyConstructor {
    address public myAddress;
    // If you want to assign a value to a variable since the contract deployment
    // you'll need to use the special constructor()Â function
    constructor() {
        // Constructor is called only once and accepts all kinds of arguments
        myAddress = msg.sender;
    }

    function setMyAddress(address someAddress) public {
        // This is handy to change something set up during the deployment
        myAddress = someAddress;
    }
}
